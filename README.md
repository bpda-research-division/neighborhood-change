## Key features

* simultaneous view of multiple types of variation (over space, over time, and within a population)
* users "move through time" at their own pace using interactive controls
* multi-selection of small geographies for users to create custom areas of interest (supported by on-the-fly data aggregation)

## About

The Neighborhood Change Explorer was originally built by the Research Division of the Boston Planning and Development Agency to display demographic and housing data for the city of Boston. However, the full list of topics has since expanded and the underlying data are regularly updated. This application is designed to be a more generalized, modular framework for the interactive visualization of geographically aggregated time-series data. 

To learn more about how the app works and how you can create your own version of it, see the [about page](ABOUT.md).
